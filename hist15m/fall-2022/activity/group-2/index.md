## Discussion Questions

Be ready to introduce this tool to the class, guided by these prompts:
- Who is the audience for this tool?
- What do you like and/or dislike about the tool?

## Instructions

2. As a group, work together to add content blocks. Add sections for each location of interest, including text, photos, and an embedded map. You can pull content from the [class spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IvlEkqBaVNtLMNVdUe8GkGnERyabTzvOVqINw9pllOs/edit#gid=0).
