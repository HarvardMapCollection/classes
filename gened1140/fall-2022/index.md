## Midterm mapping tutorial 

[Midterm mapping tutorial](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/classes/gened1140/fall-2022/assignment)

Follow this online tutorial with text descriptions, pictures, and GIFs instructing you on how to create digital GIS maps. These maps will help you be able to better answer the midterm writing prompt. If you want to skip the mapping tutorial and jump to the maps, skip ahead to the [Browse Maps and Data section](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/classes/gened1140/fall-2022/assignment/).


## Midterm mapping workshop

Rather than read through the midterm GIS tutorial yourself, you can learn how to do it in a workshop setting with Belle in the Media Lab Annex in Lamont Library. You can sign up for those workshops at the links below.
