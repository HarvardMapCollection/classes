# Mapping Assignment

## What you will learn (and some GIS basics)

In this mapping assignment, you will gain familiarity with the following useful GIS competencies:

1. Common GIS data types.

_Chart showing the difference between the two main GIS data types: **vector** and **raster**._

To make your own map someday, you'll need to be comfortable with the two main forms of GIS data: **vector** and **raster** data.

Vector data, pictured on the left consists of points, lines and polygons. When you download a vector dataset (usually in **shapefile** format), the data table will look just like any other excel spreadsheet you have worked with in the past, with columns and rows. In vector GIS datasets, however, every row in the table is a map **feature**. For instance, a **point** dataset might contain records about every church, post office, or library in a country. Every row in the table would be one post office, and every column would be some piece of information about that post office.



2. Working with georeferenced maps (raster data).



Georeferencing is the process of lining up an old map so it overlays on modern geography. There are many historical maps created before the time of computers which contain useful information. Knowing how to work with georeferenced maps will allow you to take a digital scan of any old map and use it alongside other digital datsets.

## What you will need

In order to work on this assignment, you will need the free, open-source desktop software QGIS. This tutorial will teach you how to download it, and use some of it's most useful features. 

There are many software options for working with, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data. QGIS is a favorite, as it is free, lightweight, and doesn't require a login or license. If you learn QGIS now, you'll be able to use it and all of its functionalities long after you graduate.

To download QGIS, visit the [QGIS download page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). Select the `long-term release (most stable)`.

Install the program. 

### Size constraints
The QGIS application is about 3.2GB. If you don't have enough space on your computer, the following places in the library have computers you can use:
- [The Lamont Multimedia Lab](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/lamont-multimedia-lab) in B-level of Lamont (drop in hours 9am-10pm)
- [The Map Collection](https://library.harvard.edu/libraries/harvard-map-collection) in Pusey Library (you can drop by between 10-4:30, but to assure a time slot, you can email us at [maps@harvard.edu](mailto:maps@harvard.edu))

### Mac users
If you get an error message that Apple canâ€™t check the app for malicious software, right-click the application and select `Open`.
