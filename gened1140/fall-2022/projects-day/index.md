## Class activity 

### First 20 minutes

Break into groups and discuss with each other:

1. Which data sources do you suspect might exist for your project or you are already considering using?
2. Which data sources do you need for your project but are unclear whether they exist, or how you might find or create them?
3. Are there any other questions about how it all works to create your map?

### After 20 minutes

We will come back together and you will share what you discussed. Scott and Belle will help fill in the unknowns.
